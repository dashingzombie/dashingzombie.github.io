# Research Experience

### Caicedo Lab  
**Machine Learning Research Assistant**  
Morgridge Institute for Research, Madison, WI  
July 2024 – Present  

- Leveraged **DINOv2** for Latent Representation Learning: Applied DINOv2 to learn latent representations of phenotypic responses in a pooled CRISPRi dataset with multiplexed IF readout. Customized the model for 14-channel images, fine-tuned it, and released it as open source for researchers worldwide.
- Collaborated with the **Spatial Technology Platform Lab at the Broad Institute**: Analyzed data from D10, D21, and D28 samples, identifying strong separation in UMAP plots. Assessed the model’s discriminative capability through pairwise gene-gene classification, achieving high consistency with Cell Profiler Features and demonstrating effective single-cell embeddings analysis using the above DINOv2 fine-tuned approach.

### Bick Lab  
**Project Lead, Research Assistant**  
Madison, WI  
February 2023 – June 2024  

- Engineered the **Insect Eavesdropper**: Developed a new device from an idea to achieve a 96% precision for pest sound identification, detecting even the faintest sounds produced by pests present inside plants using machine learning algorithms.
- Data Analysis and Interpretation: Utilized **DINO models, autoencoders, and transformers** in conjunction with other machine learning techniques to analyze large volumes of acoustic data. Identified intricate patterns indicative of pest activity, leading to profound insights into pest behavior and enabling highly effective pest management strategies.
- Introduced **BugPulse with affordable LiDAR technology**: Achieved a 30% increase in accurate species identification in challenging environments, expanding the scope of reliable data collection for pest management efforts.
- Enhanced Species Identification with **NERF**: Utilized Neural Radiance Fields (NERF) technology to enhance species identification accuracy within the BugPulse system. By integrating NERF with LiDAR technology, achieved a 30% increase in accurate species identification, enabling more precise and efficient pest monitoring in various environmental conditions.
- Helped secure **$350,000 USD** in research grants for the project.

### UW Robotics and Graphics Lab  
**Research Assistant**  
Madison, WI  
October 2021 – December 2022  

- Sensor Evaluation and Robustness Testing: Conducted precision assessments of **VL53L3CX** and **VL6180X sensors** using ROS, Gazebo, and a UR5 robot arm, measuring standard deviation in distance measurements at various distances. Also examined the sensors’ tolerance to oblique angles (±40 degrees), ensuring robustness in real-world scenarios.
- Real-World Calibration Precision: Successfully conducted the calibration procedure in real-world experiments with VL53L3CX and VL6180X sensors. Achieved average position precision of **3.18 mm** and **7.29 mm**, respectively, along with orientation precision of **0.61°** and **2.01°**, respectively.
- Quality Assessment through 3D Scene Reconstruction: Tested and confirmed the accuracy of calibrated sensor poses through 3D scene reconstruction. Achieved average residuals of less than **2mm** for the VL53L3CX sensor, indicating high-quality reconstruction of previously unseen planar objects.
