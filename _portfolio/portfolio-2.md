# Insect Eavesdropper: Revolutionizing Pest Monitoring

The **Insect Eavesdropper** is a groundbreaking project that leverages machine learning algorithms to detect and identify pest sounds with **96% precision**, even for faint sounds produced by pests inside plants. This innovation has the potential to transform pest management in agriculture by enabling early detection and precise monitoring of crop pests.

## Overview

The Insect Eavesdropper was developed as part of my research at the **Bick Lab** at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It uses advanced machine learning techniques, including **DINO models, autoencoders, and transformers**, to analyze large volumes of acoustic data. The system identifies intricate patterns indicative of pest activity, providing profound insights into pest behavior and enabling highly effective pest management strategies.

### Key Features:
- **High Precision**: Achieves **96% accuracy** in identifying pest sounds.
- **Affordable LiDAR Integration**: Enhanced species identification accuracy by **30%** in challenging environments using affordable LiDAR technology.
- **Neural Radiance Fields (NERF)**: Integrated NERF with LiDAR to further improve species identification accuracy by an additional **30%**.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enables real-time digital monitoring of crop pests via vibrational signals.
